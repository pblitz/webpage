In 2018, I challenged myself to read one book a week (52 in total). Thanks to goodreads and a lot of recommendations from friends, colleagues and family I got to read some great books this (past) year. I this post I want to share the ones I can recommend (or not) - and also the ones that go into the challenge for this year.

The books I read usually go into either into the (Software) Product Development or Management category. This year, it was mostly Management - little to none for Product Development, at least not in the top picks.

## [Factfulness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness)

While not strictly a business book, this analytical look at the world based by the famous TED talk wow'd me this year. It reshaped how I view the world. And everybody I talked to later one would either not believe the content or wanted to read it. So if you haven't yet, go out and read it.

## [5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)

In the Five Dysfunctions the author uses a engaging little story/fable to explain his points about what make a team work or fail. Very short, easy to read (especially compared to the next one on the list :) but still insightful. I automatically started to compare this to my team(s) behaviours.

## [The Machine That Changed the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93904.The_Machine_That_Changed_the_World)

From an easy read to a much more complicated one - but worthwhile. As far as I can understand (not having been there and such) this is the book that encompassed and started the Lean Production movement in the 90s/early 2000. While I don't know a lot about car manufacturing (and still don't), I was interested in the origins of Lean (Startup/Management). And this book delivers. While not answering all (my) questions, the book is bursting with insights. Both into car manufacture and lean management.

## [Und mittags geh ich heim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17339577-und-mittags-geh-ich-heim)

This german book (sorry about that) is pretty much the counterpart to "Machine That Changed the World" - it explains in a simple, easy to read story how one entrepreneur moved his automotive supplier company into Lean Production - without mentioning Lean Production or other complicated theories, but explained as "common sense". While I did not get around to validate the story, it reads compelling and true to my experiences.

## Further Recommendations
You can see the full list of the business books I read (and rated) 2018 over at [goodreads - part 1](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45412662-patrick?page=1&shelf=2018%2Cprofessional) and [goodreads part 2](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45412662-patrick?per_page=50&shelf=non-fiction&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

## Not recommended
In 2018, there were a couple of books I started and did not like:

* Organizational Physics - While an interesting concept, it's a very boring and (for me) uninspired read - there are better books with the same content
* The One Thing - The One Thing is focus. And the Author goes to great lengths to explain this. But it's just that: focus (on your work). Better dealt with in a blog post in my eyes. Not worth a book.

# My to Read List for 2019
The books I'm currently looking at for 2019 are:

* [Accelerate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate) (currently reading it - this looks really really promising for a development team)
* Hooked (one of the standards - I guess I should have read it a long time ago)
Platform Revolution
* [Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) - One of the books I'm quite unsure how I have managed to not read until now.
* [Start with Why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why) - Purposeful organizations and why to have them
