I guess this is my intro into another blog, blitz.dev. I relly liked the domain, so I guess I gotta do something with it, right? 

Obviously, I have a plan with this site. I don't expect it to be stick, but let's see where it will take us. 

I mostly spend my time on three things: 
* Work as a Developer/Team Lead @ ProGlove, working on good iIot stuff
* Being a father to two beautiful daughters
* Some fun projects with one or the other

This page will cover mostly the later two points. I won't bore you with work and such - at least not a lot. 
Mostly, I'll highlight some of the things I found out building projects for my daughters or for my home in general.
